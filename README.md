# 3-SAT Solver

## Overview
This project implements a solver for the 3-SAT problem using Java, CSS, JavaFX, and SceneBuilder. The 3-SAT problem is a classic problem in computer science and computational complexity theory, where the task is to determine if there exists an assignment of true/false values to the variables in a boolean formula, such that the entire formula evaluates to true.

The solver implemented here can handle boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with clauses of different lengths. It utilizes the JavaFX library for the user interface and SceneBuilder for designing the GUI.
